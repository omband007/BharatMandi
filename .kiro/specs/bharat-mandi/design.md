### Key Design Principles

1. **Offline-First Architecture**: Core features must work without internet connectivity
2. **AI at the Edge**: Machine learning models run locally on devices for instant results
3. **Trust Through Transparency**: All transactions are verifiable and traceable
4. **Vernacular-First**: Multi-language support with voice interfaces for accessibility
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic features work offline, enhanced features require connectivity

### Technology Stack

- **Mobile**: React Native for cross-platform development (iOS/Android)
- **Edge AI**: TensorFlow Lite for on-device ML inference
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for transactional data, MongoDB for document storage
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for images and documents
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live notifications
- **Voice AI**: Speech-to-text and NLP for Kisan-Mitra
- **Payment**: Integration with UPI, NEFT, and escrow service providers

```

### Offline-First Sync Strategy

The platform uses a multi-tier sync strategy:

1. **Immediate Local**: All user actions are saved locally first
2. **Background Sync**: When connectivity is available, sync queue processes pending operations
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Server timestamp wins for transaction states, merge for Photo-Log entries
4. **Selective Sync**: Only sync data relevant to user's region and activity

## UI Wireframes and Screen Mockups

### Design Principles for UI

- **Simplicity First**: Clean, uncluttered interfaces with clear call-to-action buttons
- **Vernacular Support**: All text in user's preferred language with culturally appropriate icons
- **Offline Indicators**: Clear visual feedback when offline mode is active
- **Touch-Friendly**: Minimum 44x44pt touch targets for easy interaction
- **High Contrast**: Readable in bright sunlight (common in farming environments)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential information first, details on demand

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Fasal-Parakh Module (AI Quality Grading)

**Purpose**: Analyze produce images and generate quality certificates offline.

**Components**:
- Image Capture Interface
- TensorFlow Lite Model Runner
- Quality Certificate Generator
- Model Update Manager

**ML Model Architecture**:
- Base: MobileNetV3 (optimized for mobile)
- Custom classification head for A/B/C grading
- Multi-task learning: size estimation, color analysis, defect detection
- Model size: <50MB for offline deployment

**Interface**:
```typescript
interface FasalParakhModule {
  captureImage(): Promise<ImageData>;
  analyzeImage(image: ImageData): Promise<GradingResult>;
  generateCertificate(result: GradingResult): DigitalQualityCertificate;
  updateModel(modelVersion: string): Promise<void>;
}

interface GradingResult {
  grade: 'A' | 'B' | 'C';
  confidence: number;
  sizeMetrics: {
    averageSize: number;
    uniformity: number;
  };
  colorMetrics: {
    dominantColor: string;
    uniformity: number;
  };
  defects: {
    count: number;
    severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    types: string[];
  };
}

interface DigitalQualityCertificate {
  id: string;
  produceType: string;
  grade: 'A' | 'B' | 'C';
  timestamp: Date;
  gpsCoordinates: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
  };
  imageHash: string;
  gradingDetails: GradingResult;
  farmerID: string;
}
```

**Grading Logic**:
- Grade A: <5% defects, high uniformity (>85%), optimal size range
- Grade B: 5-15% defects, medium uniformity (70-85%), acceptable size range
- Grade C: >15% defects, low uniformity (<70%), or size issues

### 2. Smart Escrow System

**Purpose**: Secure payment mechanism with AI-validated delivery.

**Components**:
- Payment Gateway Integration
- Nodal Account Manager
- Delivery Validation Engine
- Auto-Release Scheduler

**Interface**:
```typescript
interface EscrowSystem {
  createEscrow(transaction: Transaction): Promise<EscrowAccount>;
  depositFunds(escrowID: string, amount: number): Promise<PaymentReceipt>;
  validateDelivery(escrowID: string, deliveryProof: DeliveryProof): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  releaseFunds(escrowID: string): Promise<PaymentConfirmation>;
  initiateDispute(escrowID: string, reason: string): Promise<DisputeCase>;
}

interface EscrowAccount {
  id: string;
  transactionID: string;
  amount: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'locked' | 'released' | 'disputed';
  buyerID: string;
  farmerID: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
}

interface DeliveryProof {
  deliveryPhoto: ImageData;
  timestamp: Date;
  gpsCoordinates: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
  };
  buyerSignature: string;
}

interface ValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  qualityMatch: number; // 0-100 percentage match
  discrepancies: string[];
  autoApproved: boolean;
}
```

**Validation Logic**:
- Compare delivery photo with original certificate using same AI model
- Auto-approve if quality match >90%
- Flag for manual review if match 70-90%
- Auto-dispute if match <70%

### 3. Photo-Log (Digital Diary)

**Purpose**: Visual timeline of farming activities for record-keeping and credit assessment.

**Components**:
- Photo Capture with Metadata
- Activity Categorization
- Timeline Viewer
- Export Generator

**Interface**:
```typescript
interface PhotoLogModule {
  captureActivity(category: ActivityCategory): Promise<PhotoLogEntry>;
  getTimeline(farmerID: string, dateRange: DateRange): Promise<PhotoLogEntry[]>;
  analyzePatterns(farmerID: string): Promise<ActivityInsights>;
  exportForLoan(farmerID: string, format: 'pdf' | 'json'): Promise<ExportData>;
}

type ActivityCategory = 'tilling' | 'sowing' | 'spraying' | 'fertigation' | 'harvest';

interface PhotoLogEntry {
  id: string;
  farmerID: string;
  category: ActivityCategory;
  photo: ImageData;
  timestamp: Date;
  gpsCoordinates: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
  };
  notes?: string;
  linkedTransactionID?: string;
  syncStatus: 'local' | 'synced';
}

interface ActivityInsights {
  totalActivities: number;
  categoryBreakdown: Record<ActivityCategory, number>;
  averageCycleDuration: number;
  suggestedNextActivity: {
    category: ActivityCategory;
    recommendedDate: Date;
    reason: string;
  };
}
```

### 4. Credibility Score Engine

**Purpose**: Calculate credit score for farmers based on platform activity.

**Components**:
- Score Calculator
- Historical Data Analyzer
- Score Updater
- Lender API

**Interface**:
```typescript
interface CredibilityScoreEngine {
  calculateScore(farmerID: string): Promise<CredibilityScore>;
  updateScore(farmerID: string, event: ScoreEvent): Promise<CredibilityScore>;
  getScoreHistory(farmerID: string): Promise<ScoreHistory[]>;
  generateLenderReport(farmerID: string): Promise<LenderReport>;
}

interface CredibilityScore {
  farmerID: string;
  overallScore: number; // 300-900 (CIBIL-like range)
  components: {
    transactionHistory: number; // 35% weight
    paymentReliability: number; // 30% weight
    farmingConsistency: number; // 20% weight
    produceQuality: number; // 15% weight
  };
  lastUpdated: Date;
  trend: 'improving' | 'stable' | 'declining';
}

interface ScoreEvent {

## Error Handling

### Error Categories

1. **Network Errors**: Connection timeouts, DNS failures, API unavailability
2. **Validation Errors**: Invalid input data, missing required fields, constraint violations
3. **Business Logic Errors**: Insufficient funds, expired listings, unauthorized actions
4. **AI Model Errors**: Low confidence predictions, model loading failures, corrupted images
5. **External Service Errors**: Payment gateway failures, SMS delivery failures, storage errors

### Error Handling Strategy

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Core features (grading, photo-log) work offline
- Non-critical features show cached data when services unavailable
- User-friendly error messages in local language

**Retry Logic**:
- Network requests: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s max)
- Payment operations: 3 retries with manual fallback
- Sync operations: Continuous retry until success

**Error Recovery**:
- Failed transactions: Automatic rollback with notification
- Corrupted local data: Re-sync from server
- Model loading failures: Fall back to previous model version

**User Feedback**:
- Clear error messages explaining what went wrong
- Suggested actions for resolution
- Option to contact support for critical errors

### Specific Error Scenarios

**Grading Failures**:
```typescript
interface GradingError {
  code: 'LOW_CONFIDENCE' | 'CORRUPTED_IMAGE' | 'MODEL_ERROR' | 'UNSUPPORTED_PRODUCE';
  message: string;
  suggestedAction: string;
  retryable: boolean;
}
```

- Low confidence (<60%): Suggest retaking photo with better lighting
- Corrupted image: Request new photo
- Model error: Fall back to manual grading option
- Unsupported produce: Suggest similar supported types

**Payment Failures**:
```typescript
interface PaymentError {
  code: 'INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS' | 'GATEWAY_ERROR' | 'ACCOUNT_BLOCKED' | 'TIMEOUT';
  message: string;
  transactionID: string;
  retryable: boolean;
  alternativePaymentMethods: string[];
}
```

- Insufficient funds: Show required amount, suggest alternative payment methods
- Gateway error: Retry with exponential backoff, offer alternative gateways
- Account blocked: Direct to support with contact information
- Timeout: Verify transaction status before retry

**Sync Conflicts**:
```typescript
interface SyncConflict {
  entityType: 'transaction' | 'photo_log' | 'listing';
  localVersion: any;
  serverVersion: any;
  resolutionStrategy: 'server_wins' | 'merge' | 'manual';
}
```

- Transaction conflicts: Server always wins (source of truth)
- Photo-Log conflicts: Merge both versions (union)
- Listing conflicts: Server wins, notify user of changes

## Testing Strategy

### Dual Testing Approach

The testing strategy employs both unit testing and property-based testing as complementary approaches:

- **Unit Tests**: Verify specific examples, edge cases, and error conditions
- **Property Tests**: Verify universal properties across all inputs
- Together they provide comprehensive coverage: unit tests catch concrete bugs, property tests verify general correctness

### Property-Based Testing

**Framework**: fast-check (JavaScript/TypeScript) for React Native codebase

**Configuration**:
- Minimum 100 iterations per property test
- Each test tagged with reference to design property
- Tag format: `Feature: bharat-mandi, Property {number}: {property_text}`

**Example Property Test Structure**:
```typescript
import fc from 'fast-check';

describe('Feature: bharat-mandi, Property 1: Grading Analysis Completeness', () => {
  it('should return complete grading result for any produce image', () => {
    fc.assert(
      fc.property(
        fc.record({
          imageData: fc.uint8Array({ minLength: 1000, maxLength: 10000 }),
          produceType: fc.constantFrom('tomato', 'potato', 'onion', 'wheat')
        }),
        async (input) => {
          const result = await fasalParakhModule.analyzeImage(input.imageData);
          
          // Verify all required fields present
          expect(result).toHaveProperty('grade');
          expect(result).toHaveProperty('sizeMetrics');
          expect(result).toHaveProperty('colorMetrics');
          expect(result).toHaveProperty('defects');
          
          // Verify grade is valid
          expect(['A', 'B', 'C']).toContain(result.grade);
          
          // Verify metrics structure
          expect(result.sizeMetrics).toHaveProperty('averageSize');
          expect(result.sizeMetrics).toHaveProperty('uniformity');
          expect(result.colorMetrics).toHaveProperty('dominantColor');
          expect(result.defects).toHaveProperty('count');
        }
      ),
      { numRuns: 100 }
    );
  });
});
```

### Unit Testing

**Framework**: Jest for React Native

**Focus Areas**:
- Specific examples demonstrating correct behavior
- Edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, extreme conditions)
- Error conditions and exception handling
- Integration points between components
- UI component rendering and interactions

**Example Unit Test Structure**:
```typescript
describe('Fasal-Parakh Module', () => {
  describe('Grade Assignment', () => {
    it('should assign grade A for produce with <5% defects and high uniformity', async () => {
      const mockImage = createMockImage({ defectRate: 0.03, uniformity: 0.9 });
      const result = await fasalParakhModule.analyzeImage(mockImage);
      expect(result.grade).toBe('A');
    });
    
    it('should assign grade C for produce with >15% defects', async () => {
      const mockImage = createMockImage({ defectRate: 0.2, uniformity: 0.6 });
      const result = await fasalParakhModule.analyzeImage(mockImage);
      expect(result.grade).toBe('C');
    });
    
    it('should handle corrupted image gracefully', async () => {
      const corruptedImage = new Uint8Array([0, 0, 0]);
      await expect(fasalParakhModule.analyzeImage(corruptedImage))
        .rejects.toThrow('CORRUPTED_IMAGE');
    });
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

**Scope**: Test interactions between major components

**Key Integration Points**:
- Grading → Certificate Generation → Listing Creation
- Order Placement → Escrow Creation → Payment Lock
- Delivery Validation → Fund Release → Notification
- Photo-Log → Credibility Score Calculation
- Offline Capture → Sync → Cloud Storage

**Example Integration Test**:
```typescript
describe('End-to-End Transaction Flow', () => {
  it('should complete full transaction from listing to payment', async () => {
    // Create listing with quality certificate
    const certificate = await createQualityCertificate();
    const listing = await createListing({ certificate });
    
    // Buyer places order
    const order = await placeOrder(listing.id);
    
    // Verify escrow created and funds locked
    const escrow = await getEscrow(order.transactionID);
    expect(escrow.status).toBe('locked');
    
    // Simulate delivery and validation
    await simulateDelivery(order.transactionID);
    
    // Verify funds released
    const updatedEscrow = await getEscrow(order.transactionID);
    expect(updatedEscrow.status).toBe('released');
    
    // Verify notifications sent
    expect(mockNotificationService).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      expect.objectContaining({ type: 'FUNDS_RELEASED' })
    );
  });
});
```
